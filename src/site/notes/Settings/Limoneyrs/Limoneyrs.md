# Description
Limoneyrs is [[Players/Core Group/Kyle McCord\|Kyle McCord]]'s game setting for his D&D game. It is a strange alien universe full of many star systems, each with different factions, planets, and characters. This universe was created during play by [[Settings/Limoneyrs/Characters/PCs/Bela Rrorstar/Bela Rrorstar\|Eyrs Thonich]]’s [[Settings/Limoneyrs/Events/The Wish\|Wish]] and is named after her and [[Settings/Limoneyrs/Characters/NPCs/Limonar the Light\|Limonar the Light]], a multiversal entity who used her wish to build the new universe out of the scattered fragments of a demolished multiverse.

Naturally, Limoneyrs is a strange mix of contradictory genres and locations which would’ve otherwise been found in very different realities. Whether you enjoy fantasy, horror, science fiction, westerns, crime noir, or dinosaurs - it can all be found in Limoneys! Sometimes all at once.
