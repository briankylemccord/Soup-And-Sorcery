[[ 2023-02-27\|Previous Changelog]] | [[2023-03-01\|Next Changelog]]
Here’s a list of all the changes that have been made in the Soup & Sorcery vault today:
- LocationRegion template is being worked on behind the scenes. It kind of branched off into worldbuilding Limoneyrs’ new Underdark, “Wild Webs,” but I’m getting back on track now.
- An upcoming sessions page was added.
- A behind the scenes task list was added to keep track of all the documentation that needs to be added to the vault.
