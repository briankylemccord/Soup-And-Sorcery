Welcome to Soup and Sorcery! We are a group of friends who have been playing TTTPGs together every week since 2018. 

## Our Settings
Our group has unique situation where nearly all of us run games. Instead of a “forever DM,” we have a rotation between several active campaigns in several original game settings.
